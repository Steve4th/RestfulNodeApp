A REST NodeJs Application

This is my first attempt at building a NodeJS application. As such this app is a learning tool and not intended to do much. 

This is app is based on the worked example provided by Christopher Buecheler http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/

Contents
/public - static directories suchs as /images
/routes - route files 
/views - views using Jade for project
app.js - central app file for project
package.json - package info for project
